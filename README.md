* Evaluate and compare model performance
* Visualize predicted vs actual prices

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* Keras / TensorFlow (for LSTM)
* Yahoo Finance (yfinance API)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

---

## 📊 Models Implemented

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

---

## 📈 Sample Output

* Actual vs Predicted Price Line Graphs
* RMSE and MAPE for each model
* Comparative analysis of performance
